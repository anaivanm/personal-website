			<p>I am a web developer and an avid film watcher. I am a book worm and a coffee drinker. I have a diverse tech and education experience. I have worked in a variety of customer-facing jobs from customer support to account management. This has helped me get a better understanding of what the customer wants, what the company wants and how tech delivers. I found the latter more compelling so here I am.</p>

			<p>I value effective teamwork, innovation and simplicity.</p>
